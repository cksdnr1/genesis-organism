# Phase37 plan review

APPROVED96/100, no blocker/medium risk for scoped fixture implementation. Pending
evidence retention, duplicate byte comparison and no-follow traversal are explicit;
no unresolved storage/authority/reset decision left to coding. Four boundary
faults, offline independent recovery and negative corpus justify retained helpers.
No new module hierarchy, core dependency, birth journal or external publication.
