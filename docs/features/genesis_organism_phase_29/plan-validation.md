# Phase29 plan review

Score: 96/100. APPROVED; no blocker/medium risk. Existing core APIs admit experience
and children, complete lineage validates before counts, independent verifier reads
retained bytes. Failure retention precedes any cleanup. Fixed scheduling/resource
limits and matched origins close post-hoc/control drift. No generic framework,
population consensus or extra phase. Public fixture signing is isolated and explicit.
