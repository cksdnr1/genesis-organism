# Phase35 technical review

APPROVED96/100 for audit scope. Independent grammar gap is explicitly identified
and bounded by D08 and the existing12-view demo, with tamper controls. No new
protocol/storage/authority/lifecycle decisions. Full original gate matrix must
distinguish actual readiness from rehearsal preparation. No blocker/medium risk
for performing this audit; failure would produce NO-GO, never a gate waiver.
