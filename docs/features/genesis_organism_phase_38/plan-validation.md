# Phase38 plan review

APPROVED96/100; no blocker/medium risk for bounded rehearsal. Exact source pin,
accepted bytes and negative controls remain necessary evidence. Explicit PID
absence, complete journal review and no timeout prevent silent lock takeover.
Concurrency, all mutation boundaries and independent replay are tested before
completion. No source/authority/storage/lifecycle contract left undecided during
coding. No new core state/module/service or actual ceremony implied.
