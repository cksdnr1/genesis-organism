# Phase32 proposal plan review

Score: 96/100 for research plan. APPROVED documentation scope only. No architecture
or implementation change is authorized. The plan preserves pending D12/D01 gates,
current local evidence and exact reviewable skip recommendation. It cannot claim
complete Phase32 execution or proceed to dependent phases without acceptance.
No new phase, numeric complexity score, speculative chain abstraction or birth.
